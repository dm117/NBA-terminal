# NBA-terminal

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dm117/NBA-terminal/master/screenshot.png)

An open-source, simplistic terminal application that displays the NBA schedule for the day. Inspired by tty-clock: https://github.com/xorg62/tty-clock. Written in C/C++.

The goal: To make a minimalistic and beautiful terminal application that displays the NBA schedule for the current date. No user input is necessary as the program fetches the date from your computer and displays the schedule accordingly.

**Must have the package "wget" installed or download the CSV from the repo**

How to (OSX and Linux):

- Download the folder under "release" (you can get rid of everything but the "NBA" executable)
- Run NBA (usually using "./NBA").
- If it's your first time running the program (ever) it will download the CSV so you'll need to run it again.

What it does now:

- Displays the schedule for the day automatically

- Colored output (unobtrusive colored text that matches the teams' color).

- Output now displays the schedule in rows and columns instead of vertically.

What needs to be worked on: 

- Code clean up.
