# NBA-terminal
An open-source, simplistic terminal application that displays the NBA schedule for the day. Inspired by tty-clock: https://github.com/xorg62/tty-clock. Work in progress...

The goal: To make a minimalistic and beautiful terminal application that displays the NBA schedule for the current date. No user input is necessary as the program fetches the date from your computer and displays the schedule accordingly.

What it does now:

- No set up is required on Linux. Just download and run the executable "NBA".

- Must download the CSV file manually if you want to use it on Windows.

- Output now displays the schedule in rows and columns instead of vertically!

What needs to be worked on: 

- Colored output (unobtrusive colored text that matches the teams' color). COMING REALLY SOON!

- Full windows support.

Feel free to fork and/or contribute!
