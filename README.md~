# NBA-terminal
An open-source, simplistic terminal application that displays the NBA schedule for the day. Inspired by tty-clock: https://github.com/xorg62/tty-clock. Work in progress...

The goal: To make a minimalistic and beautiful terminal application that displays the NBA schedule for the current date. No user input is necessary as the program fetches the date from your computer and displays the schedule accordingly.

What it does now: Displays NBA schedule vertically. No set up is required on Linux. Must download the CSV file manually if you want to use it on Windows.

What needs to be worked on: Output (displaying the schedule in rows and columns instead of vertically), colored output (unobtrusive colored text that matches the teams' color), make the code portable so Windows users don't have to download the file manually.
